            <span class="fw-bold">Filing A Complaint</span> <br>
            At Brainiac we take every project with the final product in sight. It is as much our responsibility as the client’s. So, we believe that every effort should be made to reach a solution that is fully acceptable reciprocally in case of any situation where dissatisfaction related to services comes. Only when things are completely out of hand that refund should be considered.
Our final aim is to come to a mutually acceptable solution. Even then if for some reason you are not satisfied and think about going for a refund claim, it is our request that you take out a few precious minutes to write to us at support@eclickapps.com for a final dialogue prior to requesting a refund.
Only if we are unable to reach a common ground with you after talks should a refund claim be filed.
          </p>

            <span class="fw-bold">Eligibility For Refund</span> <br>
            At Brainiac every project is important to us and we make sure that we handle each project with utmost care and professionalism. Our aim is to provide the results as per the terms and conditions of the proposal. However, despite every measure if the client is not satisfied with the results and chooses to go for the dispute resolution process, we consider refund requests as per the following program in which our services and refund policy related to each service is very clearly listed:
          </p>
            <p class="lineh pb-4">
              <span class="fw-bold">Website/ Graphic Design</span> <br>
             Full refund: In cases only where the project has not been started and the client has decided to cancel the project within 7 days of signup. The Full Refund policy will initiate after we receive the upfront payment and will take 7 days to refund the amount that is after deducting the fees and charges we incur for the payment gateway while returning the amount. <br> <br>
             Full refunds are also made if the clients have made a payment in error or made an extra payment above the cost of the project. <br>

Up to 75% refund: If the project is cancelled within 2-3 days after payment and project acquisition then up to 75% of the amount paid will be refunded as we had already assigned the design and the technical teams to the job after the payment has been confirmed hence we deduct 25%. <br> <br>

No Refunds: If the client says "I did not like the work" after the cooling-off period of 7 days from the time the designs and the last work update has been sent the client is not entitled to any refunds whatsoever. We strive to understand your concept and you can share your ideas in an email. As a part of our service, we revise the designs multiple times based on your comprehensive feedback. Hence we give you a time frame to go through the work and let us know your comments accordingly. <br> <br>

Partial refund: If there is a failure to deliver as per our delivery policy after the approval of the initial design style. The partial refund will be in proportion to the work completed. <br> <br>

No refunds: If the project has been completed and uploaded on the server. <br> <br>

Payments for custom design projects are made to us in project instalments as a courtesy to the client. Once a payment or deposit is made, it is non-refundable. If a project is cancelled or postponed, all monies paid are retained by Brainiac and if applicable, a fee for all work completed beyond what was already  been paid for shall be paid by the client.
